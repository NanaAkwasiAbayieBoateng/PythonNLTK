    "#### INTRODUCTION TO NLP IN PYTHON WITH SPACY\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy is a relatively new package for “Industrial strength NLP in Python” developed by Matt Honnibal at Explosion AI. It is designed with the applied data scientist in mind, meaning it does not weigh the user down with decisions over what esoteric algorithms to use for common tasks and it’s fast. Incredibly fast (it’s implemented in Cython). If you are familiar with the Python data science stack, spaCy is your numpy for NLP – it’s reasonably low-level, but very intuitive and performant."
