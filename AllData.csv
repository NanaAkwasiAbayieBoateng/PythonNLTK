Management treats the union members with kit gloves and the upper management treats the subordinates rough (Business Unit Leaders)  get ready to run like a rickshaw driver because due to the buyouts they are very under staffed and created a (ganged position) that use to be broken up with 3 to 4 people Hence the “Business Unit Leader”.  Be ware !!!!!!!!!!  I would suggest that you turn around and run the other way as fast as you can.  Chrysler doesn't pay any more than a Tier 1.  That being said, you would be much better off working for a much less intense employer for more or perhaps the same compensation with less or no management in fighting. Case and point this position is one of the worse in the company and if you wondering how horrible it is research how often Chrysler is looking for Business Unit Leaders.  That’s the proof ;)They will tell you it not for everybody, that’s CODE for it’s not for anybody. In addition Chrysler is still in bankruptcy as so far as paying back the loan, it was a refinance through a lender for a lower rate.

Solid base salary, four days on, three days off with the ""occasional added production shift ""as demand dictates."" I am telling you now since no one told me, ""demand"" will dictate quite often. It is nothing to work 15-20 days straight at 12+ hours/day. It is also easy to put in 140+ two week pay period without blinking. As for the workplace/culture of a unit leader, you are expected to fit 13 hours of tasks into a 10 hour shift thanks to your very useless ""support"" departments that serve no other function than to add work to your plate. Oh, and this is in addition to your actual job of keeping the production line running/directing manpower. Of those departments, I would rate the safety team the worst. They are required to do nothing involving actual plant safety, as all projects, medical investigations/passes and safety tours are expected to be completed by (you guessed it) production unit leaders. The safety team as well as the other support teams do nothing but compile reports to present to the plant leadership of what tasks the unit leader was unable to accomplish.The operations management is an abomination as you will not find standardized instruction to be the same across multiple shifts.

Unfortunately, downturns in sales sometimes result in layoffs and new hires or low seniority employees will most likely be stuck on the ‘C’ crew of the AWS system. This is the 10 hour per day, 4 days per week, alternating between day and night shift.The attendance program is strict.Since Chrysler was obtain by Fiat, we operate by WCM. World Class Manufacturing’s lean principles are utilized more intensely than our old TPM system. It is forcing needed improvements in communication, training, preventive and predictive maintenance. Continuous improvement is one of the core focus points, in theory. In practice, it all comes down to the daily part counts and making the daily build rate. If production will not release a machine for PM’s during the week, maintenance has to be scheduled on weekends. Because we have a policy of balanced hours for each tradesman, and not everyone wants to work overtime, often repairs are done by tradesmen working outside their normal departments on machines they are not familiar with. This presents a challenge and sometimes has less than satisfactory results. Sometimes ‘band-aids’ applied will correct a problem temporarily, but if the root cause is not corrected, greater damage will eventually occur. The old saying “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” is sometimes overused.Overall the people here are good to work with.

Because our job consisted of working with our own customers and dealers, our attendance was very important and if a case manager was out on vacation or sick, we would have to help with the load and contact their customers and dealers before contacting our own. However, this was also something that I did not like. When someone was missing, a few of my coworkers would complain about it and would dim the mood.

The reason that there is such high turnover is that none of the mid-level management team has the backbone or the brains to get anything done.
